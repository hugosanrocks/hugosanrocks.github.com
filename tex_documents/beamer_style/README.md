# Beamer theme

Directory containing some styles, fonts and other required files for the beamer presentation template.

Beamer theme installation directory.

This is a modified version of Metropolis (https://github.com/matze/mtheme) and the official SEISCOPE template.

There are two ways to use the theme:

1: copy the '.sty' files in the working directory of your beamer presentation

or

2: type 'make install' inside this folder to directly install this theme on your machine (in your home).

The second method avoid the copy of '.sty' files in each presentation.
