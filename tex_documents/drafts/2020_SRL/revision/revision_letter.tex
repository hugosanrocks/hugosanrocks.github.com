\section*{Associate Editor Comment}

We have received two excellent reviews of this manuscript. In general, the reviewers agree that the manuscript provides valuable analysis and results that are appropriate for publication at SRL. Reviewer 2 raises some questions about the details of the analysis and makes some suggestions that could lead to improvements in their results, while Reviewer 1 asks important questions about the implications of the results, in particular about whether or not the pattern observed for this earthquake sequence is unique or common.

\section*{Reviewer \#1}


\subsection*{Summary}

This study investigates a seismicity sequence associated with a Mw 4.4 in central Italy. They use network-matched-filtering (which includes waveform cross correlation), clustering, and relocation to detect a large number of earthquakes and then classify them into clusters. They find that one cluster involved a large number of events prior to the mainshock. The study provides an example of how to investigate a seismicity sequence when there is sufficient station coverage near the epicenter. The main questions, to me, are whether the interpretations are reliable (do the dots illuminate a fault?) and whether they are significant (is this earthquake novel, in the global sense)? The authors have done a great job motivating the study and establishing the literature. From my comments below, I suggest that major revisions would be needed. The scientific approach appears to be sound, but the presentation of results could be improved and expanded in order to justify the significance. \\

{\bf Key points (from author):} \\
\begin{itemize}
 \item[1] The analysis of the 2019 Balsorano earthquake sequence reveals that imbricated complex processes occur before and after the main earthquake. 
 \item[2] Clear differences between foreshocks and aftershocks are highlighted by the distinct spatio-temporal patterns unraveled by our analysis.
 \item[3] These results demonstrate that simple earthquake preparation models are not suitable enough to correctly mimic the observed complex reality.
\end{itemize}



\begin{ReviewerComment}{1}
\noindent 
Given the detailed study of this M4 earthquake, and also the relevance of the fault planes inferred from the focal mechanism, it would be good to display a figure showing the waveform fits between data and synthetics. Such a figure might be available already from INGV. Or maybe the authors can generate such a figure using an alternative code.
\end{ReviewerComment}


\begin{Answer}
We agree with reviewer \#1 about the importance of adding this relevant figure. We have included a modified version of the figures provided by the INGV (\url{http://webservices.ingv.it/webservices/ingv_ws_map/data/tdmt/15111/73711301_86_tdmt_reviewer_solution.pdf}) showing the estimated focal mechanism together with a comparison between observed and estimated synthetic sesimograms as part of the supplementary material (as figure S2). We also present here below this figure. The former figure S2 (from the previous version) was removed according to the following comments from reviewer \#2 and this new figure related to the focal mechanism and synthetic seismograms took its place.

L104. "According to a geological study of the location of the main event and its focal mechanism (Supplementary Material Table S1), this event ruptured the Liri fault (Roberts and Michetti, 2004), which is one of the major active normal faults mapped in this region." \\

I did not see the evidence for choosing one of the two fault implied from the focal mechanism. (I looked in the supplement.) This is a critical piece, since the assumed fault plane is referenced in Figure 5.
\end{ReviewerComment}


\begin{Answer}
Thnaks for your comment. We consider that the evidence can be observed looking at the surface geololy. According to the work from \cite{Falcucci2016active}, which details the seismic active faults in this region, the second nodal plane from table S1 (strike 166$^o$, dip 42$^o$ and rake -51$^o$) coincides much better with the segment of the surface scarp of the normal Liri Fault. In order to emphasize the superficial scarp of the related Liri Fault, in the revised version we improve the former figure 1, increasing the resolution of the topography and including the observed fault scarp of the Liri fault reported by \cite{wedmore2017667}. We hope that this evidence is clearer in this version of the manuscript. This new figure is also included here below (as figure 2).

\begin{ReviewerComment}{1}
\noindent 
From one event, it is difficult to understand the significance of the findings. Did the authors point their same set of tools at a couple other events? What if all mainshocks in this region have foreshock sequences? What is the meaning of "normal" seismicity sequences in this region? In other words, is this one earthquake significant, or do many other earthquakes -- when examined this closely -- show such complexity? In particular, are there foreshock sequences such as Cluster 1?

\begin{ReviewerComment}{1}
\noindent 
I have never done Coulomb stress modeling, but it seems like it was developed for this kind of study, where the fault is (likely) known, and the mechanism would predict aftershock occurrences in certain regions.
\end{ReviewerComment}


\begin{Answer}
We totally agree with reviewer \#1 about the potential of performing a Coulomb stress analysis in the region. However, the geometry of the faults, and subfaults, that were activated during this sequence are not known (except from the one associated to the mainshock). In addition, the focal mechanisms of most of the earthquakes in the sequence can not be determined due to their small size, noise levels and limitted azimuthal coverage. Finally, the slip distribution of the mainshock was not studied or inverted before. Therefore, the available information does not allow to perform a proper Coulomb stress analysis of this sequence. The above information is usually required by the available softwares performing such analysis \citep{toda2011coulomb}. We add (from lines 316 to 322) to the revised version a small paragaph listing the obstacles to perform such analysis for this sequence.

Figure 5 is key and needs improvements. There's too much white space to see the details.  Perhaps zoom into +/- 1 km and then leave the full +/- 3 km version in the supplement? No legend is needed, since the caption will tell us that a=Cluster1, b=Cluster2, etc. Save space by not displaying a, b, three times.

We agree with reviewer \#1. We changed figure 5 in the revised version of the manuscript taking into account your comments and suggestions. We also include more information in this new version, such as the geometry of the auxiliary plane (NP1 in Table S1) and the location of the different templates belonging to each of the inferred clusters. You can also find the new version of this figure here below as figure 3.

If the choice of fault plane is in question, then it would be good to see an alternative version of Figure 5, where the projection planes are chosen based on the now-assumed auxiliary plane (under the assumption that it is the mainshock fault plane).

\end{ReviewerComment}


\begin{Answer}
We think that the main fault plane is not under discussion thanks to the superficial evidence (from the new version of figure 1 in the main manuscript).

We agree with reviewer \#1. This suggestion, and the previous one, are taken into account in the revised version of the main manuscript. This new figure is also included in this response letter as figure 5. We decide to leave the 90\% concentration line included in the right column of figure 4 (in main manuscript). We consider that this line illustrates the different ways that clusters behave and how their occurrence and location are particular to each group. In addition, the main manuscript makes reference to this line to stress out the different behaviors exhibited during the sequence.

\section*{Reviewer \#2}

\subsection*{Summary}

This is an overall strong paper that is suitable for publication following minor edits. The authors perform a detailed analysis of foreshocks and aftershocks of the Mw 4.4 2019 Balsorano earthquake and demonstrate the complexity of these sequences, including apparent initiation on an antithetic fault. The authors first enhance the existing earthquake catalog using template matching. Next, they cluster events based on waveform similarity. Last, they relocate the majority of the newly detected events using the double-difference algorithm. The paper is clearly organized and the implications related to initiation processes and rupture complexities are very interesting.  \\


\subsection*{Template matching}

\begin{ReviewerComment}{2}
\noindent
Enhancing the catalog to 714 events is a significant improvement. However, using 23 out of 135 available catalog events as template earthquakes seems low and may prevent additional event detection. Is the 1-second pre-pick discussed on line 132 before the P-phase arrival? If so, why is the pre-pick time so long? This introduces noise to the signal - about 25% of the waveform - that decreases the signal-to-noise ratio that is then used in template selection. More templates would likely meet the SNR criteria with a shorter pre-pick, unless I misunderstand this 1-second pre-pick.

\end{ReviewerComment}


\begin{Answer}
We appreciate this comment. Regarding the 1-second pre-pick time window, we performed several tests with longer and shorter windows before defining the final duration of this window. Our results with longer windows totally agree with the comment from reviewer \#2, we had less detections and the correlation coefficients had lower values. In contrast, when shorter windows were used we did not see any significant increment of the number of detections. We did not exhaustively explore the results when shorter ($<$ 1 second) windows were used but the number of detections was not affected by this duration length.   
\Assignment{Hugo} \WorkInProgressRevTask
\end{Answer}
%
%

\begin{ReviewerComment}{1}
\noindent 
It would be helpful to provide the hypocentral locations and magnitudes of template events in Table S4, and include a map of template earthquakes to give a better idea whether detections (including the 13-15 km depth concentration of seismicity) are biased by template locations. Further, focal mechanisms of templates if available would provide additional information about potential biases in earthquake detection (i.e., if locations and focal mechanisms of templates are very similar, dissimilar events will not be detected). That being said, the results do not seem to be over-interpreted and a discussion of these potential biases would be adequate.

\end{ReviewerComment}


\begin{Answer}
We took into account these suggestions and we included more details of the 23 templates as part of the supplementary material (Table S5). In addition, we include also figure S6 to illustrate the relative location (with respect to the mainshock hypocenter) of the 23 templates. Furthermore, we modified figure 5 from the main manuscript to illustrate the location of the templates that belong to each of the different clusters composing the sequence. In this response letter, you can see these modification in figures.

The relative location of the 23 templates used for scanning the continuous recordings are represented by the center of the colored circles. The color code used defines to which cluster each of the templates belongs to. All of the locations are relative to the mainshock hypocenter (41.7746$^o$N 13.6066$^o$E; 13.94 km depth, black star). The directions A-A' (along strike) and B-B' (normal to the strike) are the same as in Figure 1 in the main manuscript.}

\begin{ReviewerComment}{2}
\noindent 
The method to determine the magnitude of earthquakes detected with template matching makes sense. However, the least-square fitting to obtain a linear model for magnitudes using only 23 earthquakes is unlikely to be robust. I suggest using more earthquakes in the INGV catalog to develop this model prior to applying it to the newly detected events.

\end{ReviewerComment}


\begin{Answer}
Thank you for this comment. We totally agree with reviewer \#2 about the possible lack of robustness of the newly estimated magnitudes. However, the estimated magnitudes are used only as a very cualitative measurement in our analysis. We do not use the estimated magnitudes to go further in our analysis or conclusions. Therefore, we think that the estimated magnitudes (using these 23 templates in the least squares model) are enogh accurate for the scope this study. We decided to include as part of the supplementary material figure S5, which illustrates the least squares model that we used for the magnitude estimation. This figure is also included in this response letter as figure \ref{fig:S5_lsq_model}.

\subsection*{Clustering}

\begin{ReviewerComment}{2}
\noindent 
Line 169 states that members of the same cluster should share similarities in position and rupture mechanism.  However, the locations in cluster 3 vary widely. The station nearest to the study region will not have large S-P time differences for most of the events; therefore, events in different locations with similar mechanisms might appear similar. Please expand on this in the waveform-based clustering section of methods, or consider using a farther station (or combining the results of multiple stations) for the waveform-based clustering.

\begin{ReviewerComment}{2}
\noindent 
The stacked waveform for cluster 3 in Figure 3c is smaller amplitude than the other stacked waveforms and it is difficult to identify phase arrivals. This is likely because events in this cluster are not as similar as other clusters. Please discuss the similarity in this cluster more in the main text.

\noindent 
Pre-seismic: Line 302 in the Conclusion states that there is a lack of repeating earthquakes in the foreshock sequence. This should be mentioned earlier, perhaps near Lines 256-261 in the Results and Discussion section where the lack of evidence for aseismic slip is discussed.

\begin{ReviewerComment}{2}
\noindent 
Post-seismic: Line 275 attributes clusters 4 and 5 to afterslip on the main fault. Afterslip can also trigger seismicity/aftershocks off of the main fault (Inbal et al., 2017) but this is still a reasonable mechanism. Is there a log(time) dependence in spatial expansion in these clusters that may also indicate aseismic slip? Are any repeating earthquakes present in the aftershock sequence that may be indicative of co-planar afterslip? I assume not since the foreshocks are the most highly correlated, but it is still worth mentioning in the discussion of afterslip as a mechanism.

Be consistent with defining small and medium (or moderate-sized) earthquakes. Line 24 has small earthquakes classified as  Mw<5, Line 54 has medium-events listed as Mw < 6, and Line 83 has small-magnitude events classified as Mw<6. It is most common to consider M 4-6 as moderate-sized and Mw < 3 as small magnitude earthquakes. I recommend grouping small to moderate-sized earthquakes as Mw < 6 consistently.
