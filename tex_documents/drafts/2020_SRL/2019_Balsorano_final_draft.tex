\begin{abstract}

Foreshocks in the form of microseismicity are among the most powerful tools to study the physical processes that occur before main earthquakes. However, their detection and precise characterization is still sparse, especially for small to moderate-sized earthquakes (M$_w<6$). We present here a detailed foreshock analysis for the November 7, 2019, Balsorano (Italy) normal fault earthquake (M$_w$ 4.4). To improve the detection of the microseismicity before and after the mainshock, we use six three-component broadband receivers at distances of less than 75 km from the targeted seismicity, through template matching. To improve the understanding of the physical mechanism(s) behind the earthquake initiation process, as well as other accompanying phenomena, we also detail the spatio-temporal evolution of the sequence associated to this medium-sized earthquake, using waveform clustering and hypocenter relocation. Clear differences between foreshocks and aftershocks are revealed by this analysis. Moreover, five distinct spatio-temporal patterns associated to the different seismic activities are revealed. The observed spatio-temporal behavior shown by the foreshocks highlights a complex initiation process, which apparently starts on an adjacent unmapped antithetic fault. Finally, the aftershock activity comprises four different clusters with distinct spatio-temporal patterns, which suggests that the different clusters in this sequence have distinct triggering mechanisms.

\section*{Introduction}

The detection of signals that can inform us about a forthcoming earthquake is fundamental to build physical models that mimic the processes behind the triggering and nucleation of earthquakes. These physical models are important because they provide us the basis to characterize earthquakes. Therefore, the study and analysis of precursory signals are of great importance. Over the last 25 years, numerous studies have reported a wide range of observations that appear to be connected with the physics that precedes large seismic events \citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{Rikitake_1975_EP, Jones_1979_SCF, Molchanov_1998_PES, Eftaxias_2000_DEE, Virk_2001_HRP, Singh_2010_PSU, DeSantins_2019_PWS, Jones_1985_FTE, Abercrombie_1996_OPF, Felzer_2004_COA, Dodge_1996_DOC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE, Yoon_2019_FMN, Reasenberg_1999_FOB, ruiz2017nucleation, ruiz2014intense}. Among these, some of the most compelling are the ones based on seismological characterization of foreshock sequences, as well as other seismological observations and their relationships with mainshocks \citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{Jones_1985_FTE, Abercrombie_1996_OPF, Reasenberg_1999_FOB, Felzer_2004_COA, Dodge_1996_DOC, Bouchon_2011_ENI, Ruiz_2014_IFS, ruiz2017nucleation, Ellsworth_2018_NIE, Yoon_2019_FMN}. Foreshocks are thus one of the most useful tools to understand the physics of earthquake initiation in real faults \citep{Brune_1979_IET, Abercrombie_1996_OPF, Malin_2018_MPE}. Therefore, it is important to improve foreshock observations and characterization, particularly for the more frequent small to moderate-sized events (\emph{i.e.} M$_w <$ 6), as these might share similar physical processes with larger events. These improved observations may shed light on the physical processes that occur during the triggering and nucleation of earthquakes and will drive future research that focuses on theoretical and numerical models to better characterize earthquake occurrence in real and complex faults. 

Earthquake initiation \citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{Kato_2012_PSS, Schurr_2014_GUP, Tramutoli_2015_VCR} and earthquake nucleation/triggering \citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{Dieterich_1992_ENF, Ellsworth_1995_SEE, Rubin_2005_ENR} are two different, and perhaps overlapping, phases of the seismic cycle. While the first is understood to occur over the longer term preceding a large event (\emph{i.e.}, days or months, to years), the second occurs some minutes toThe results of the spatio-temporal evolution for the identified clusters suggest complex evolution of the seismicity. Two fault planes are activated during the sequence, with foreshocks primarily occurring on the antithetic fault plane (Fig. 5a, cross-section), similarly to part of the foreshock activity that was observed for the L'Aquila normal fault earthquake \citep{Chiaraluce_2011_AAN}. Relying only on our observations, it is hard to unravel which mechanism(s) might be responsible for the occurrence of the foreshocks, and thus the driving of the main event. For example, there are no exponential or power-law increments of events seen while approaching the main event \citep{Papazachos_1975_FEP,Kagan_1978_SSO}, which might suggest accelerating aseismic slip \citep{Dodge_1996_DOC, Bouchon_2011_ENI, Tape_2018_ENF}. Neither are any spatial patterns seen (\emph{e.g.}, migrations) that might suggest the same mechanism, or might alternatively indicate triggering by stress transfer \citep{Dodge_1996_DOC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE, Yoon_2019_FMN}. However, we clearly outline the differences between the foreshocks and aftershocks. In particular, the foreshocks occur in a more temporal clustered manner, and they are closer to the hypocenter of the main event (Fig. 4a). The compact and highly temporal clustered seismicity indicates strong event interactions, and favors stress transfer as the mechanism for foreshock occurrence \citep[COV,][]{Schoenball_2017_SAS}.
 seconds before the main event. Both phases, however, can be explained under the Dieterich model (\citeyear{Dieterich_1994_CLR}), which relates the seismicity rate to the stressing history through a rate-and-state constitutive law. For earthquake initiation in particular for real faults, two main hypotheses are currently used to explain this process. Some authors argue that a mainshock is a consequence of a cascade process, with stress transfer in-between events, which eventually trigger the large event \citep[\emph{e.g.},][]{Dodge_1996_DOC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE, Yoon_2019_FMN}. Alternatively, the initiation of an earthquake can be understood as an aseismic process that weakens the pre-existing asperities, until a larger rupture is promoted \citep{Dodge_1996_DOC, Bouchon_2011_ENI, Tape_2018_ENF}. In the latter case, foreshocks result from the activation of brittle asperities by the surrounding slip processes. However, intermediate models that involve both triggering and aseismic slip are likely for complex faults \citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{mclaskey2019earthquake}. This complexity might result from fault heterogeneity (\emph{e.g.}, variable stress, frictional properties) and promote imbricated sequences of foreshocks and aseismic slip \citep[\emph{e.g.},][]{dublanchet2018dynamics}.

The monitoring of foreshocks is today routine in laboratory experiments \citep[][and references therein]{Zang_1998_SAA, Goebel_2012_IFH, Renard_2019_VSP}, while  studies that focus on large earthquakes remain relatively sparse (\emph{i.e.}, M$_w>$6) \citep[\emph{e.g.},][]{Mogi_1963_SDA, Abercrombie_1996_OPF, Kato_2012_PSS, Chen_2013_CFS, Bouchon_2013_LPP, Ruiz_2014_IFS}. However, the recent improvements to seismological monitoring systems around active faults have now provided detailed analysis of foreshocks that precede the more frequent small to moderate-sized earthquakes (M$_w <$ 6) \citep[\emph{e.g.},][]{Savage_2017_PPS, Mcmahon_2017_STE, Malin_2018_MPE}. One intriguing feature that has emerged from these more recent studies is the increased complexity (\emph{i.e.}, fault interactions, volumetric processes) that have been revealed through the availability of better data (\emph{e.g.}, near-fault receivers) and more advanced detection methods (\emph{e.g.}, template matching) to study foreshocks. This complexity might challenge the actual laboratory scale and theoretical models, which treat earthquake initiation as simple physical processes that occur in smooth fault planes \citep{Dieterich_1992_ENF, Marone_1998_ELR, Rubin_2005_ENR, Liu_2005_AST}. The necessity for high-resolution characterization of foreshocks based on good data and advanced data processing techniques was also suggested by a meta-analysis carried out by \cite{Mignan_2014_DPV}, which indicated resolution-dependent bias for earthquake initiation models that were resolved using seismological data. 

To shed new light on the physical processes that occur before relatively small earthquakes, we study here the medium-sized (M$_w$ 4.4) Balsorano normal fault earthquake and its foreshock-aftershock sequence (Fig. 1). The Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (\emph{Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia}; INGV; \href{http://terremoti.ingv.it/it/event/23414191}{\color{blue}online catalog}) reported that the main event of this sequence occurred on November 7, 2019 (17:35:21.18 UTC), approximately 4 km southeast of Balsorano city in central Italy (Fig. 1). The hypocenter of this main event was located relatively deep in the crust (14 km), close to the transition zone between the upper and lower crust (10-20 km in depth), where the brittle locked fault transitions into the ductile regime zone \citep{Doglion_2011_RBD}. Below this depth, the lower crust is relatively seismically silent \citep{Doglion_2011_RBD}. According to a geological study of the location of the main event and its focal mechanism (Supplementary Material Table S1), this event ruptured the Liri fault \citep{Roberts_2004_STV}, which is one of the major active normal faults mapped in this region. This structure accommodates the  low extension rate observed in this region (\emph{i.e.}, a few millimeters per year) \citep{Hunstad_1999_UBR, Westaway_1992_SMS, Dagostino_2001a_ACE, Roberts_2004_STV}.

In addition to the mainshock of November 7, 2019, 135 events occurred close to the epicenter of the main event from October 22 to November 15, 2019 (which included 25 foreshocks). Starting from these cataloged events, we study here the 'anatomy' of the foreshocks and aftershocks, and their relationships with the main event. With this aim, continuous data from six three-component stations at less than 75 km from the mainshock epicenter are used (Fig. 1; Supplementary Materials Table S2). The continuous waveforms recorded are analyzed using template matching techniques \citep{Gibbons_2006_DLM, Shelly_2007_CET} to detect smaller events and thus to expand upon the available seismic catalog. The detected events are then relocated using the double-difference method \citep{Waldhauser_2001_HDD}, to reveal the geometry of the main fault and to obtain new insights into the fault-slip behavior(s) before and after the main seismic event. Furthermore, through waveform clustering, we isolate families of earthquakes that are representative of different physical processes that occur in the pre- and post-mainshock period. This combination of detection, relocation, and waveform clustering reveals an imbricated seismic sequence where several faults were activated, and with clear differences in the spatio-temporal properties of the foreshocks and aftershocks.

\section*{Methods} 
\label{sec:methods}

{\bf Template matching:} The analysis starts by extending the INGV seismic catalog using the template matching approach \citep{Gibbons_2006_DLM}. From the 135 events reported by the INGV online catalog \href{http://terremoti.ingv.it/en}, where 25 events are identified as foreshocks, we retain only the events with available P-wave and S-wave picks for all of the six stations used. We then extract 4 s of signal, starting 1 s before the phase arrival time from the band-pass filtered data (5-20 Hz). Using the pre-picked signals, we estimate the signal-to-noise ratio and retain as templates only those events with a signal-to-noise ratio $>$3 at all of the stations. With this data selection, 23 events are obtained (including three foreshocks) that are the templates used for scanning the continuous data (Supplementary Materials Table S4). We use three-component data with P waves extracted from the vertical component, and S waves extracted from the East and North components.

In all, 28 days of continuous data are processed, from October 22 (\emph{i.e.}, 16 days before the mainshock) to November 15, 2019, using the fast matched filter algorithm from \cite{Beauce_2017_FMF}. The detection thresholds are set to 12 times the daily median absolute deviation of the summed correlation coefficients over the array of stations. Finally, consecutive detections with differential times of $<$3 s are removed (\emph{i.e.}, the time difference between two estimated origin times).

The final catalog contains 714 events (166 foreshocks, 547 aftershocks), which represents $\sim$ 6-fold the number of events in the initial catalog. To estimate the magnitudes of the newly detected events, we use the average root mean square in the time window containing the S waves over all of the stations and components. Least-square fitting is then used to obtain a linear model that relates the logarithmic of the root mean square of the 23 templates and their local magnitudes from the INGV catalog. This model is then used to estimate the magnitude of the newly detected events. A summary of the event occurrences in time together with their magnitudes is shown in Figure 2.

{\bf Waveform-based clustering:} Clustering is widely used in seismology to recognize patterns in spatio-temporal events, which include the identification of foreshock-aftershock sequences and stress evolution in time \citep[\emph{e.g.},][]{Kagan_1991_LTE, wehling_2013_IDT, Cesca_2014_SMC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE}. Here, we apply waveform similarity analysis \citep{Cattaneo_1999_WSA} to define groups of events that share similar locations and/or a common rupture mechanism \citep{Kagan_1991_LTE, wehling_2013_IDT, Cesca_2014_SMC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE, Cattaneo_1999_WSA}. For this, the full normalized waveforms are used, with a 4.5-s time window (starting 0.5 s before the P-wave arrival) that contains both the P phase and the S phase. 

The waveforms of the 714 detected events recorded at the closest station to the epicenter (Fig. 1, VVLD) are then correlated with each other. The correlation matrix obtained (Fig. 3a) is used to estimate the distance (dissimilarity) metric to perform hierarchical clustering. The Ward minimum variance method is used \citep{Ward_1963_HGO} with  a distance threshold of 5.5 defined (Supplementary Materials Fig. S1: the largest separation observed from the dendrogram). This waveform similarity analysis highlights five different clusters, as shown in Figure 3b, c.  As both the P waves and S waves are used for clustering, the resulting family members should share, to some extend, similarities in position and rupture mechanism \citep{Kagan_1991_LTE, wehling_2013_IDT, Cesca_2014_SMC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE, Cattaneo_1999_WSA}. However, due to the proximity to the study region of the recording station used in this analysis (VVLD), short S-P time differences are observed for most of the events in the sequence. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that events occurring in different locations with similar mechanisms might appear strongly related.

{\bf Relocation:} We finally estimate the relative location between the detected events using the double-difference algorithm (HypoDD software; \cite{Waldhauser_2001_HDD}). The differential times of the P phases and S phases between events from the cross-correlation are estimated, with the retention of only the delays that are associated to correlation coefficients $>$0.6. We further limit the delays to 0.2 s. After discarding the event pairs that relate less than 3 P-wave and 3 S-wave highly correlated differential times (correlation coefficient, $\geq$ 0.6), the final number of 29859 pairs are kept and used in the relocation process. 

For each newly detected event, we assume its initial location as the coordinates of the template that reports the highest correlation coefficient related to that event. In addition, we assume the estimated P-wave and S-wave picks obtained from our template matching analysis as the initial catalog information for the relocation. A velocity model for this region proposed by \cite{Bagh_2007_BSC} is used in the relocation process (Supplementary Materials Table S3). Following previous studies \citep{Shelly_2019_IFC}, the inversion is performed with stronger weights to the initial information related to the P-wave and S-wave picks from the catalog (\emph{i.e.}, from the template matching analysis), while the differential times from the waveform correlations control the final iterations. In the end, 689 of the 714 newly detected events are successfully relocated. The temporal and geometric patterns observed in this earthquake sequence are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, and are further described in the following section.

\section*{Results and discussion}
\label{sec:results}

The time evolution of the detected events is shown in Figure 2. Of the 714 events, 166 are foreshocks (23\%). Together with the temporal evolution, Figure 2a shows the spectrogram and the average spectral energy in a frequency band from 5 Hz to 20 Hz. The oscillation of this energy suggests variable noise levels in the study area, with lower noise during the night (Figure 2, shaded areas, for periods from 18:00 to 06:00). This noise variation is related to anthropogenic activity \citep{Poli_2020}, and it is also observed for the other five receivers. This noise evolution will probably affect our detection performance. For example, it is not clear if the reduced number of events observed prior to the mainshock is real or is a consequence of the higher noise level (Fig. 2b). We thus avoid discussing any issue related to pre-seismic quiescience here. However, with the geometric and clustering information derived above, we can still characterize some of the properties of the newly detected foreshocks and aftershocks, and gain insight into the physical processes that occur at the different stages of the sequence.

The results from the combination of waveform clustering and relocation strategies are summarized in Figures 4 and 5. For each cluster, the coefficient of variation (COV) is also estimated from the recurrence time of the events \citep{Kagan_1991_LTE, Schoenball_2017_SAS}. The COV indicates the level of the temporal clustering within each group (\textit{i.e.}, how much the occurrence of future earthquakes depends on the occurrence of the past earthquakes): with COV=1 for random seismicity, and COV$>$1 for strong temporal clustering. The larger the COV, the more the earthquakes are interacting. Thus, it is important to note that events that happen together with a high COV mean that there is an intrinsically related interaction between them.

The temporal and spatial densities of the different clusters identified in this sequence are illustrated in Figure 4, where cluster 1 (green solid lines and dots) is mainly composed of foreshocks (161 of 209 events occurred before the mainshock). The events that form this family show the highest waveform similarity (Fig. 3a). In agreement with this waveform property, cluster 1 has high spatial density, with approximately 90\% of its activity (193 of the 208 events) located within 0.5 km of the mainshock hypocenter (Figs. 4a and 5a). Cluster 1 also shows the highest temporal clustering (COV=4.8; Fig. 4a).

The next two families, as cluster 2 (COV=3.0; Figure 4b, blue solid lines and dots) and cluster 3 (COV=2.9; Figure 4c, magenta solid lines and dots), share similar temporal clustering values, but show differences with respect to their spatial densities. While approximately 90\% of the events of cluster 2 are within 0.8 km of the hypocenter (136 of 151 events; Fig. 4b), cluster 3 has almost 90\% of its activity (187 of 211 events) located over a larger volume, as approximately 1.2 km from the mainshock location (Fig. 4c). Cluster 4 (Figure 4d, brown solid lines and dots) is characterized by 90\% of its activity within 0.6 km of the mainshock hypocenter (53 of 59 shocks; Fig. 4d). The seismicity in this cluster is also characterized by high temporal clustering (COV=4.2). Cluster 5 (COV=2.2; Figure 4e, red solid lines and dots) is the least temporally clustered, but with the second highest spatial density (after cluster 1), with 90\% of its activity in a region 0.5 km from the mainshock hypocenter (66 of 73 events; Fig. 4e). A general spatial pattern of this sequence is the concentration of events close to the mainshock that occurred prior to it (110 foreshocks within 0.3 km) and the subsequent spread over a region $>$0.3 km during the aftershocks.

Figure 5 illustrates the geometric patterns related to each of the clusters, as defined by the relocation process. A remarkable pattern can be seen in Figure 5a: cluster 1 (\emph{i.e.}, foreshocks) shows an antithetical orientation with respect to the assumed fault plane of the main event (Fig. 5a, map view and cross sections). In contrast, clusters 4 and 5 show nearly parallel orientations with respect to the assumed main fault plane (Fig. 5d, e, cross-sections, respectively). We also observe particular behavior for cluster 5, which is the only cluster where the activity is exclusively to the northeast of the mainshock hypocenter and on the footwall (Fig. 5e, map view and cross-sections). The events in cluster 5 follow an orientation that is parallel to the assumed main fault plane dipping angle (Fig. 5e, cross-section). In turn, cluster 3 has an activity that follows the orientation of the fault plane, but that spreads across the whole volume surrounding the fault plane (Fig. 5c, cross-sections).

The results of the spatio-temporal evolution for the identified clusters suggest complex evolution of the seismicity. Two fault planes are activated during the sequence, with foreshocks primarily occurring on the antithetic fault plane (Fig. 5a, cross-section), similarly to part of the foreshock activity that was observed for the L'Aquila normal fault earthquake \citep{Chiaraluce_2011_AAN}. Relying only on our observations, it is hard to unravel which mechanism(s) might be responsible for the occurrence of the foreshocks, and thus the driving of the main event. For example, there are no exponential or power-law increments of events seen while approaching the main event \citep{Papazachos_1975_FEP,Kagan_1978_SSO}, which might suggest accelerating aseismic slip \citep{Dodge_1996_DOC, Bouchon_2011_ENI, Tape_2018_ENF}. Neither are any spatial patterns seen (\emph{e.g.}, migrations) that might suggest the same mechanism, or might alternatively indicate triggering by stress transfer \citep{Dodge_1996_DOC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE, Yoon_2019_FMN}. However, we clearly outline the differences between the foreshocks and aftershocks. In particular, the foreshocks occur in a more temporal clustered manner, and they are closer to the hypocenter of the main event (Fig. 4a). The compact and highly temporal clustered seismicity indicates strong event interactions, and favors stress transfer as the mechanism for foreshock occurrence \citep[COV,][]{Schoenball_2017_SAS}.

Analyzing the waveform-based correlation matrix (figure 3a), which is built based only on the similarity of waveforms on the vertical component at the closest station, we are able to distinguish approximately 60 pairs with correlation coefficients larger than 0.95. However, given the fact that most of the events in the sequence have significantly small magnitudes (70\% of the events have magnitudes lower than 0.5, figure 2c) and that the frequency range used in the analysis is limited from 5 to 20 Hz, we consider that the available information does not allow us to properly conclude anything about the existance of repeaters in this earthquake sequence \citep{uchida2019,uchida2019repeating}.

Interestingly, the aftershock clusters also show different spatio-temporal behaviors between each other (Figs. 5b-e, 4b-e). The observed differences might be explained by different physical processes driving the aftershock occurrence. For example, the events in clusters 2 and 3 (Fig. 5b,c) spread in a volume around the fault. This spatial pattern is likely to result from stress redistribution, volumetric damage, and relaxation processes after the mainshock \citep{trugman2020imaging}. In contrast, clusters 4 and 5 follow the orientation of the main fault in a more compact volume around it (Fig. 5d,e), and their activity decays in a rapid manner (Fig. 4). This behavior might suggest that these latter clusters result from stress increments induced by the mainshock afterslip that occurs near the fault plane region in the few hours or days after the main event \citep{Stein_1983_HVE, Shen_1994_PDF}. These particular features from clusters 4 and 5 might support the alternative model proposed by \cite{inbal2017locally} where the afterslip from the mainshock might be the triggering mechanism of the aftershocks off of the main fault.

It is important to point out a particular feature exhibited by cluster 3. Looking at the relative small amplitude of the stacked waveform estimated for cluster 3 (figure 3c) and the resulting relocation of events (figure 5c), we consider that cluster 3 is composed of all the events that share a strong dissimilarity to the remaining events of the sequence. As it was mentioned before, we use the dissimilarity between the waveforms recorded at the closest station to the study region to infer the five different clusters. Therefore, while most of the events show short S-P time differences, these events might be occurring in different locations with similar mechanisms, which is exactly the case of the events from cluster 3.

The geometry of the subfaults that were activated during this sequence are not known (except from the main Liri fault). In addition, the focal mechanisms of most of the earthquakes in the sequence can not be determined due to their small size, noise levels and limitted azimuthal coverage of the regional network. The slip distribution of the mainshock and other subevents have not been previously studied. Therefore, the available limited information does not allow to perform a proper Coulomb stress analysis of this sequence \citep{toda2011coulomb}.

As in previous studies \citep{Mcmahon_2017_STE, Savage_2017_PPS, Mcmahon2019_STA}, we can see that this detailed analysis of seismic data reveals a complex and imbricated earthquake sequence, for which the mainshock initiation is unlikely to result from only the evolution of physical properties (\emph{e.g.}, stress, friction) on the main fault plane. Indeed the sequence begins through an interaction between the antithetic and main faults during the foreshock-mainshock sequences, similar to that observed for other events \citep{Chiaraluce_2011_AAN, Mcmahon2019_STA}. In normal faults, this behavior can be related to preseismic processes in the dilation wedge located in the hanging wall \citep{Doglion_2011_RBD}. The complexity of the sequence might also emerge from fluid involvement, which is known to have a significant role in the control of seismicity and its 'style' in the central Apennines \citep{antonioli2005fluid, poliseasonal}. The stress perturbations in the antithetic fault might have modified the local pore pressures, with fluid migration into the main fault, which would favor the occurrence of the main event \citep{Doglion_2011_RBD}. 

\section*{Conclusion}

By using a combination of high-resolution detection methods, precise relocation \citep[\emph{e.g.},][]{Gibbons_2006_DLM, Waldhauser_2001_HDD} and waveform clustering, we have unveiled the complexity of the sequences associated with the 2019 (M$_w$ 4.4) Balsorano earthquake. We detect 714 events that comprise this sequence. These events are classified into five different seismic clusters. The differences between these clusters are highlighted by their distinct spatio-temporal properties that are unveiled by the waveform-based clustering analysis \citep{Kagan_1991_LTE, wehling_2013_IDT, Cesca_2014_SMC, Ellsworth_2018_NIE}, and by their relative source locations \citep{Waldhauser_2001_HDD}.

Our results highlight different behaviors between foreshocks and aftershocks. For example, foreshocks occur in a compact region near the mainshock hypocenter, and show high temporal clustering  (Fig. 4a). The lack of repeating events (\emph{i.e.}, highly correlated events with correlation coefficient $>$0.9), strong temporal clustering, and inter-event proximity might indicate that stress transfer triggering has the main role in driving the occurrence of the foreshocks \citep{Dodge_1996_DOC}. Nevertheless, there are no observations that can exclude aseismic slip. The foreshock activity mainly take place in an antithetic fault (Fig. 5a), which suggests that the initiation processes do not only occur on one fault plane, but involve larger volumes \citep{Savage_2017_PPS}. This precursory antithetic activation has been observed in other normal fault events \citep{Chiaraluce_2011_AAN} and it can be expected in some gravity-driven normal fault models \citep{Doglion_2011_RBD}. 

Furthermore, our analysis shows diversity for the aftershocks behavior. Indeed, four different clusters comprise the aftershock sequences. Two of these four are spread in a volume around the main fault (Fig. 5b,c), and might result from stress redistribution after the mainshock (\emph{e.g.}, caused by volumetric damage and the relaxation processes; \cite{trugman2020imaging}). Given the rapid temporal decay of their activity and their compactness and spatial orientation, the remaining two clusters appear to be driven by rapid stress increments induced by the mainshock and afterslip that occur near the fault plane in the few days after the mainshock \citep{Stein_1983_HVE, Shen_1994_PDF}.

In summary, this study of foreshocks and aftershocks highlights that simple preparation models with evolution of stress and friction on a single fault plane are not suited to precisely explain the evolution of the seismicity we observe here for a real fault. A relatively large volume appears to be involved in the earthquake initiation, over a short time scale ($\sim$1 day). We further highlight how the full range of aftershocks is likely to be an ensemble average view of different processes, which will include afterslip, volumetric damage, and relaxation. Continuing to provide detailed information about foreshocks and their relationships to the mainshock and aftershocks also for relatively small events can help us to develop new and more realistic models that can provide better fitting of seismological observations and shed new light on the initiation of earthquakes in real faults.
